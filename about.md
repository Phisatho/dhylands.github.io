My name is Dave Hylands, and I'm a professional software developer, currently working for Mozilla in their Emerging Technologies group. My primary interests lie around embedded realtime programming, and interfacing with hardware (i.e. device drivers).

On the personal front, I'm interested in robotics, which has lead me to dabble in electronics, metal-working, and wood-working.

I live in Canada, near Kelowna British Columbia, which is located in the [Okanagan Valley](http://www.okanagan.com/).
