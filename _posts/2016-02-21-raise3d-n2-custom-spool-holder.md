The filament spools that came with my Raise3D printer are 200mm in diameter,
70mm thick, and have a central hole about 55mm in diameter.

I happen to have alot of spools of PLA which are 162mm in diameter, 85mm
thick, and has a central hole diameter of 31mm.

Needless to say, my spools won't fit on the N2 spool holders. So I went and
designed a spool holder using OnShape. I put the files on
[thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1360118) and on [my github
account](https://github.com/dhylands/3D-Printed-Parts/tree/master/Raise3D/Spool-Holder).

This shows the spool holder mounted in the printer:

And with a spool on it.

I can't close the door with this spool holder mounted, but that isn't really
an issue for PLA.


## Remixes

As I notice people creating variations, I'll include them here:
