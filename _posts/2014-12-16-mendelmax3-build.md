Here is some build progress (I'll append to this post as I complete more)



Here's the frame, which encloses the electronics, and Y and Z steppers:

Y axis:

Whoops. The glass clips don't quite fit (due to a last second production
change):

I decided to file a wee bit off the edge. The MTW guys also suggested raising
the clip slightly  using 3 washers.

After a few swipes with a file, they fit:

I got one of the extruders together and installed on the X-axis

Next: electronics (and I put the Z axis together but forgot to take some
pictures).
