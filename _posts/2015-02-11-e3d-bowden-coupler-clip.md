I started to get some jams on my all metal e3d hotend that came with my
MendelMax 3.

I think I found the culprit. When I cut my PFTE tube, I made it very close to
the hob:

and after using it for a while, I noticed tiny little PFTE shavings around the
top of the hotend. At the time, it didn't really occur to me that this might
cause a problem.

After I started getting the jams, I ripped about the extruder and didn't find
anything obvious wrong. I had done several cold pulls using some cleaning
filament. But then I noticed that the PFTE tube could move up and down a bit.

When the black clip at the top of the hotend is positioned like this:

[![]({{ site.url }}/images/2015-02-11/image-0001.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-11/image-0001.jpg)


then the tube is secure and won't move. However, if the black clip gets pushed
down, like so:

[![]({{ site.url }}/images/2015-02-11/image-0002.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-11/image-0002.jpg)


then the PFTE tube can move up and down by about 1mm. If the top of the tube
is less than 1mm fro the hob, then the tube will run into the hob, and the hob
can grind off small shavings. If one of those shavings goes down the tube then
it can cause a jam. The PFTE has a melting temperature between 260C and 327C
([ref](http://reprap.org/wiki/PTFE)), and my hotend typically only runs in the
190C to 240C range.

I decided that a small clip which held the black clip in the "out" position
was called for. Here's a photo of the clip:

and a couple photos of it installed:
