So I got the bed trammed, and all of the limit switches checked out. Time to
print!

For the first print, I decided to print  the [Bukito Tram
G-Code](https://bukobot.com/flight-check-bukito)

Here's a video that shows it just after I started the first print. It places 4
beads around the outside of the table, and you can examine these to see how
well you've trammed things.



Here's another video that shows the cylinders being printed.




And one showing the extruder screw.




My photo of the finished print:

A bit of closeup showing some of the fine threads on the inside of the
cylinders:

A ruler to give some scale:

And finally, a closeup of the side of the cylinder:
