I was putting together some storage shelves, and I thought it would be nice to
attach some pegboard to the shelving unit.

The legs on the shelving unit had keyhole shaped holes for holding the shelf
brackets in place. I was hoping to be able to do something like this:

The square part of a 1/4" carriage bolt looked like it would fit perfectly in
the narrow part of the keyhole, but the head was too large. So I chucked up
the bolt in my lathe and turned the diameter of the head down. I used a couple
of nuts with slits (cut via hacksaw) so I could chuck up the bolt.

It only took a few seconds to modify each carriage bolt, and I was able to
attach the pegboard like this:

Worked like a charm.
