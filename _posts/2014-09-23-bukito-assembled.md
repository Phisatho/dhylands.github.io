My [Bukito 3D Printer](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deezmaker/bukito-portable-3d-printer-take-it-everywhere)
showed up in the mail today. This was also a KickStarter. It's only about 9 months late, but it looks like it was
worth the wait.

It came as a kit, and took about 3 hours to put together. Now to level the
table and do a first print (maybe tomorrow - time to go to bed now).

The build volume is about 5" x 6" x 6" which should be fine for most of the
stuff I want to do. I figured I'd start small and then once I'm comfortable
with a 3D printer, and know what I like and dislike, I can invest in a bigger
printer.

I just discovered [Nick Lievendag's blog](http://nicklievendag.com/) and it
will be interesting to see how his evaluations turn out (for consideration in
buying a larger printer).
