I was helping out my <a href="http://blog.huv.com/">brother</a> trying to figure out why his <a href="http://blog.huv.com/2014/02/micropython-boards-crystal-trouble.html">uCee board</a> wasn't working. The STM32F4xx chips have an onboard bootloader that can flash the chip using USB, CAN, or one of 2 UARTs.<br /><br />The USB wasn't working (which was the planned interface to use), so I suggested using one of the UARTs. The next trick was to find some code for talking to the UART bootloader. I tried <a href="https://github.com/jsnyder/stm32ld">stm32ld</a> and jsnyder's <a href="https://github.com/jsnyder/stm32loader">stm32loader</a> and they would both recognize the chip but then bailed when trying to unprotect.<br /><br />I poked around a bit and came across this <a href="https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/blob/master/scripts/stm32loader.py">variant</a> from the <a href="http://www.espruino.com/">Espruino project</a>. That version works on my STM32F4DISCOVERY board and it worked on my brothers board.<br /><br />The UART bootloader wants a raw .bin file without any special headers or anything, so I used: <br /><pre class="prettyprint"><span class="nocode">arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary flash.elf flash.bin<br /></span></pre><br />to create a suitable binary file (flash.elf came from the <a href="http://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> build).<br /><br />To initiate the bootloader on the UART you need to make BOOT0 high, and then press and release RESET (keep BOOT0 high while releasing RESET). Then run: <br /><pre class="prettyprint"><span class="nocode">./stm32loader.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -evw flash.bin<br /></span></pre><br />Looking at the stm32loader.py code, it appears to support using DTR to reset the processor, and RTS to control BOOT0. I haven't tested this out yet, but it looks to be worth checking out.
