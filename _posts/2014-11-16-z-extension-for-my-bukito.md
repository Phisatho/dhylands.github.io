While I was doing the Make 2015 printer test, I noticed that the filament
tensioner would have collided with the handle if I tried to print at the full
height of 125 mm.

This photo shows the problem. The Z axis is at about 120 mm in the photo.

So I built a 15mm thick Z-Extension (shown in the orientation as printed):

Here's what it looks like when mounted:

And this shows lots of clearance now with the Z at 125mm (The original screws
for mounting the handle were M5x10 so I used M5x25 to mount with the
extension).

I posted my FreeCAD source file and the STL on
[thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:548057).
