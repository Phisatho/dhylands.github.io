I've been following Nick Lievendag's [blog](http://nicklievendag.com/) and saw
him using [Marvin](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:215703) as a quality
indicator. Marvin is fairly small - about 25mm tall, so I decided to do a
series of prints using Marvin.

Here's Marvin, printed in white PLA using my Bukito:

From left to right: 0.2mm, 0.1mm, and 0.06mm layer heights. The one on the
left got chopped because the Windows 7 laptop I was using decided to reboot to
apply an update. I'm in the process of replacing it with a Raspberry Pi
running [OctoPrint](http://octoprint.org/), but that's another blog post.

There is also a slightly blue tinge to the feet of the Marvin on the left,
which is because I had blue filament loaded for a previous print.

I used the Cura slicer, and the settings were all default (from
[here](http://bukobot.com/host-slicing-settings)). I chose the 0.2, 0.1, and
0.06mm layers just because that's what Cura suggested for low, normal, and
high quality.

I then repeated the 3 prints, but with a 20mm diameter, 25mm high cylinder
behind Marvin.

Here are the Marvins, front, back and side views, followed by the cylinders.
Some of the Marvin's still have the build support between the legs.

So now to figure out why the stringing increases as the layer height goes
down.

Incidentally, Cura has a minimum time for each layer, but as far as I can
tell, it doesn't actually work completely properly. I'm pretty sure that the
print speed slows down, but I noticed when printing the loop at the top of
Marvin's head, that it was only taking a few seconds per layer, and not the 20
I had set.

For robot parts, I think that the 0.2mm setting is more than adequate.
