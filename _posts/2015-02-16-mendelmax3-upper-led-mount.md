This compliments the [MendelMax3 - Lower LED
Mount]({% post_url 2014-12-27-mendelmax3-lower-led-mount %}) that I created earlier.

The upper mount is quite a bit bigger, so I need to have my MM3 working well
enough to print something large, and I've finally reached that point.

Similar to the lower LED mount, this one is made up of 3 parts: a back, an LED
Holder and a Shield.

I initially had problems with one end of the shield lifting when I printed it,
so I created a variation with a brim at either end.

It turns out that the white plastic piece is about the same thickness as the
U-channel that runs across the top of the printer. I wanted the white plastic
piece to be right up against the metal, so the way I designed it you need to
cut the bottom off of the white plastic. This shows a side view of everything
mounted and you can see the notch in the shield piece:

I used a sharpie marker along the edge:
[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0001.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0001.jpg)

and put a score mark using a knife blade while the platic was held in the
shield:
[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0002.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0002.jpg)

I then scored the plastic a half-dozen times using the knife:

 [![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0003.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0003.jpg)


and was able to break off the lower pieces using some pliers:

[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0004.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0004.jpg)

I wound up with this in a few places, and used a file to get the edge smooth:

[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0005.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0005.jpg)


The trimmed plastic piece should then look like this in the shield:
[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0006.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0006.jpg)
 I also puut a strip of black electrical tape across the top (this is to cover
a light gap that I found after putting everything together):

[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0007.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0007.jpg)


Oops. The slot isn't quite wide enough (the LED on the left is partially
covered):

[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0008.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0008.jpg)


That's what a nibbler is for (I'll revise the model to make the slot a few mm
wider):

[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0009.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0009.jpg)


Here it is with all of the pieces together (except the diffuser):

This is what it looks like once its all installed. I used 4 M3x25 bolts and
nuts to mount it:[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0011.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0011.jpg)


This is the light leak I was talking about earlier (that I covered up using
electrical tape):

I ran the wires in the back channel of the 2040:

[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0013.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0013.jpg)


I used one of [these clips](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1340487) at the
top and bottom:

[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0014.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0014.jpg)

And cut a piece of black posterboard to cover the wires (you can see the
posterboard in the rear slot, just to the right of the leadscrew):

[![]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0015.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2015-02-16/image-0015.jpg)
