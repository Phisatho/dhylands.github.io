I've had a ton of fun with my Bukito. But I wanted a bigger build area and
dual extruders, so I could use support material.

I looked at the MakerBot offerings and was ready to buy one, but was totally
put off by their Smart Extruder.

So the search was on. I wound up looking at the
[MendelMax2](http://store.makerstoolworks.com/printer-kits/mendelmax-2-0
-standard-kit/) from and thought it would be a nice kit to put together. And
when paging through the [MakersToolWorks](http://store.makerstoolworks.com/)
store, what should I stumble upon but a hidden link for the
[MendelMax3](http://store.makerstoolworks.com/printers-kits/mendelmax-3-full-
kit/) (at the time I found it the URL had "hidden-item" in it).

This looked like a very nice printer, so I placed an order. I think I may have
been the first non-beta person to order the MendelMax3. I also discovered that
they have an IRC group (#makerstoolworks on freenode). The MendelMax3 was
officially made available in their store a day or so later.

I decided on a kit, so that I would learn all of the various bits and pieces
and gain an intimate understanding of all the parts and how to tune it.

A couple weeks later,a nicely packed box arrived on my doorstep:

[![]({{ site.url }}/images/2014-12-16/image-0100.jpg)]({{ site.url}}/images/2014-12-16/image-0100.jpg)


Very nicely packed:

}}/images/2014-12-16/image-0101.jpg)


Here are the contents spread out on my desk:

Many of the pieces were laser cut stainless steel that was then powder coated:

Belts, clips to hold the glass, and some miscellaneous wires:

Lots of M5 and M3 nuts and bolts:

And polycarbonate wheels for the linear rails:

A few printed parts:

And a few laser cut plastic parts:

Tools (almost everything needed to assemble it):

A buck converter (to convert 24V to 5V, and an Arduino. These are used to
drive the LEDs which show up on the front panel, and across the top.
Apparently the LEDs change color based on the extruder temperature.

I also ordered the optional GLCD and the required RAMBo adapter:

This is the [RAMBo](https://ultimachine.com/content/rambo-13/) board, along
with 3 limit swiches.

Some miscellaneous electronics:

And the 2 extruders, which are both [E3D-v6](http://e3d-online.com/E3D-v6/)
all metal hot ends:

A box full of stepper motors:

A 400W  24VDC power supply. The extruders, bed heater, fans and RAMBo all run
off of 24V:

A few more laser cut metal pieces:

And a bunch of V-Slot extrusions (the wheels and extrusions are from [Open
Builds Parts Store](http://openbuildspartstore.com/):

It turns out a few small pieces were missing, which was not entirely
surprising given that this was one of the first complete kits that they
shipped. MakersToolWorks quickly shipped me the missing pieces.

I've been extremely impressed with the support available from the
MakersToolWorks guys. They have an IRC channel, and between the MTW guys and
their customers, all of the minor issues I had were quickly addressed.

Now to put it all together.
