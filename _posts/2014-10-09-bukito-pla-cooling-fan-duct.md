Deezmaker just came out with a [PLA cooling fan duct](http://bukobot.com
/bukito-pla-cooling-fan-duct) for the Bukito.

It looked cool, so I figured I'd give it a try.

I ran it through Cura with 0.1mm layer thickness and it came out looking
pretty nice.

I just received a roll of [Silver
filament](http://seacans.com/collections/pla/products/pla-silver-1-75mm-1kg)
that I ordered from [seacans.com](http://seacans.com/). Seacans is located in
Langley, BC, so I was able to order it Tuesday, and it arrived on Thursday,
and they have flat rate shipping too! I wound up ordering 6 spools of
filament, and it was only $9.99 shipping.

Here's another view:

After mounting the duct and fan, I noticed that the bottom of the duct would
collide with the 3 mounting screws which hold the bed on. So I used a 1/4"
spade drill to countersink the holes for each screw.

 This shows the before and after

 And here you can see that the distance between the bottom of the duct and the
surface is less than the thickness of the screw head from the previous
picture.

And here's the duct and fan mounted on my Bukito. You can also see the
straight lines which originate from near the corner of the bed. This is where
the head rests while the extruder is heating up, and the duct would have gone
right over the screw head:

I used #4-40 x 5/8" screws to mount the fan, since I didn't have any M2.5mm
screws. I also tapped the PLA using a #4-40 tap.
