I picked up a nifty little [XV-11 Lidar
Controller](http://www.getsurreal.com/products/xv-lidar-controller) and bought
a broken Neato XV-11 for $28 on eBay.

When I got the XV-11 it appeared to be well and truly dead. The batteries were
fully charged, but the LCD wouldn't turn on. Which was fine. All I wanted was
the Lidar sensor.

I disassembled the XV-11 and got the sensor off. Connecting the motor to 5v
made it go round, and providing 5v on the appropriate line gave me the
following on the serial port.

and a bunch of binary data if I spin the turret by hand.

I got the Lidar Controller today and hooked it up:

and it seems to work. I tried running the [Visual
Test](http://www.getsurreal.com/products/xv-lidar-controller/xv-lidar-
controller-visual-test) and was able to get this output:

which is my office (about 12 feet x 20 feet).

Very cool.

This should be useable on my indoor platform that I'm putting together.
